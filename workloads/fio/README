fio

Runs fio.  Includes a default configuration, or user can create their own
in a ConfigMap and provide the name of that ConfigMap.

Output Files
------------
json+ output is written to /output/output.json, which is the the default output
file.  The default parser is the null-parser.

Variables
---------
* fiosize: size of file used by fio for I/O.  Default is 6g
* pvcsize: size of PVC used by fio.  Should be large enough to fit `fiosize`
* rw: I/O operation mix, either randread, randwrite, read, write, or rw.
  Default is rw
* pctread: if `rw` is `rw`, the percent of the I/O operations that should be
  reads.  Default is 50
* config: name of ConfigMap with the config file for initializing fio.
  A default config file is included in this I/O workload spec named
  "fio-rw-config"
* initConfig: name of ConfigMap with the config file for initializing fio.
  Generally this config file will be the same as the one used for running fio,
  but with a shorter runtime.  A default is included in this I/O workload spec,
  named "fio-rw-initconfig"
